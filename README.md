# Glyphs

A two-dimensional pictorial language in your browser, sort of like [Befunge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) but cuter.

## Building

Make sure you have TypeScript 2.0+ and Make installed, and run `make build`.

## Usage

Either serve the root directory yourself, or if you have [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) installed, run `make serve` and open the URL it gives you. The current program is stored in the hash fragment of the URL, allowing for easy sharing and undo/redo. There's a help button with a question mark on it that explains everything else.
